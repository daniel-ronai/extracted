            I'm a high school student who loves reading books that make me think differently about life.
          </p>

          <p className="about-p-text">
            Every time I finish a book, I write down the quotes that hit hardest and explain them in my own words. 
            It helps me remember what I learned and gives me something to reference later.
          </p>

          <p className="about-p-text">
            I figured—why not share this? So here we are. Extracted is just me, a notebook, and the books 
            that are shaping how I see the world.
          </p>

          <p className="about-p-text">
            I'm planning to study electrical engineering, but I'll keep reading philosophy, psychology, 
            and anything else that helps me understand people and life better.
          </p>

            If you want to know when I post something new, join the list down in the footer. I'll only 
            email when there's a new book to share.
